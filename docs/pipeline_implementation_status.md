# Pipeline System Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the configurable pipeline system for voiceType based on [pipeline_spec.md](pipeline_spec.md).

## Completed Components

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
All core infrastructure components have been implemented:

1. **Trigger Events** ([voicetype/pipeline/trigger_events.py](../voicetype/pipeline/trigger_events.py))
   - `TriggerEvent` base class
   - `HotkeyTriggerEvent` - waits for key release
   - `TimerTriggerEvent` - waits for fixed duration
   - `ProgrammaticTriggerEvent` - no automatic completion

2. **Pipeline Context** ([voicetype/pipeline/context.py](../voicetype/pipeline/context.py))
   - `PipelineContext` class with proper type annotations
   - `IconController` protocol interface
   - Support for stage config, metadata, cancellation, and cleanup

3. **Stage Registry** ([voicetype/pipeline/stage_registry.py](../voicetype/pipeline/stage_registry.py))
   - `StageMetadata` dataclass
   - `StageRegistry` class with decorator-based registration
   - Type validation at registration time
   - Pipeline compatibility validation
   - Global `STAGE_REGISTRY` instance

4. **Unit Tests** ([tests/test_pipeline_infrastructure.py](../tests/test_pipeline_infrastructure.py))
   - Tests for all trigger event types
   - Tests for PipelineContext
   - Tests for ResourceManager
   - Tests for StageRegistry

### Phase 2: Pipeline Execution Engine ✅
All execution engine components have been implemented:

1. **Resource Manager** ([voicetype/pipeline/resource_manager.py](../voicetype/pipeline/resource_manager.py))
   - `Resource` enum (AUDIO_INPUT, KEYBOARD, CLIPBOARD)
   - `ResourceManager` class with atomic resource acquisition
   - Fine-grained locking for concurrent pipeline execution
   - Conflict detection and reporting

2. **Pipeline Executor** ([voicetype/pipeline/pipeline_executor.py](../voicetype/pipeline/pipeline_executor.py))
   - `PipelineExecutor` class with thread pool
   - Non-blocking pipeline execution
   - Automatic resource cleanup in finally blocks
   - Cancellation support
   - Graceful shutdown with timeout

3. **Pipeline Manager** ([voicetype/pipeline/pipeline_manager.py](../voicetype/pipeline/pipeline_manager.py))
   - `PipelineConfig` class
   - `PipelineManager` class for loading/validating pipelines
   - Hotkey conflict detection
   - Type compatibility validation at startup
   - `migrate_legacy_settings()` for backward compatibility

4. **Hotkey Manager** ([voicetype/pipeline/hotkey_manager.py](../voicetype/pipeline/hotkey_manager.py))
   - `HotkeyManager` class for trigger registration
   - Press/release event handling
   - Trigger event lifecycle management
   - Pipeline execution via PipelineManager

### Phase 3: Core Stages ✅
All core stages have been migrated to the new interface:

1. **record_audio** ([voicetype/pipeline/stages/record_audio.py](../voicetype/pipeline/stages/record_audio.py))
   - `TemporaryAudioFile` wrapper class with cleanup protocol
   - Registered with `STAGE_REGISTRY`
   - Filters recordings shorter than minimum_duration
   - Properly stores filtered resources in `_temp_resources`

2. **transcribe** ([voicetype/pipeline/stages/transcribe.py](../voicetype/pipeline/stages/transcribe.py))
   - Registered with `STAGE_REGISTRY`
   - Handles `Optional[TemporaryAudioFile]` input
   - Returns `Optional[str]` output
   - No cleanup responsibility (handled by pipeline manager)

3. **type_text** ([voicetype/pipeline/stages/type_text.py](../voicetype/pipeline/stages/type_text.py))
   - Registered with `STAGE_REGISTRY`
   - Handles `Optional[str]` input
   - Uses virtual keyboard for typing
   - Final stage (returns None)

### Phase 4: Configuration & Integration ✅
Settings and configuration support has been implemented:

1. **Settings Updates** ([voicetype/settings.py](../voicetype/settings.py))
   - Added `pipelines` field to `Settings` class
   - Integrated `migrate_legacy_settings()` into `load_settings()`
   - Automatic migration on settings load
   - Backward compatibility maintained

2. **Pipeline Module Exports** ([voicetype/pipeline/__init__.py](../voicetype/pipeline/__init__.py))
   - All components exported from pipeline module
   - Stages automatically registered on import
   - Clean public API

## Remaining Work

### Phase 2: Unit Tests for Pipeline Execution ⏳
- [ ] Tests for PipelineExecutor
- [ ] Tests for PipelineManager
- [ ] Tests for HotkeyManager
- [ ] Integration tests for full pipeline execution

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing ⏳
- [ ] Update `__main__.py` to use new pipeline system
- [ ] Wire up PipelineManager to application startup
- [ ] Test multiple hotkeys
- [ ] Test hotkey conflict detection
- [ ] Test pipeline cancellation
- [ ] Test programmatic pipeline triggering
- [ ] Integration testing with real audio/STT

### Phase 6: Polish & Documentation ⏳
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Create example settings.toml with multiple pipelines
- [ ] Update README with pipeline examples
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing users

## Architecture Highlights

### Type Safety
- Generic type variables (`TInput`, `TOutput`) for stages
- `StageFunction` protocol for type checking
- Validation at both registration time and startup
- Full mypy/pyright support

### Resource Management
- Fine-grained locking (AUDIO_INPUT, KEYBOARD, CLIPBOARD)
- Concurrent pipeline execution when resources don't conflict
- Atomic resource acquisition (all-or-nothing)
- Automatic resource release in finally blocks

### Cleanup Protocol
- Pipeline manager SOLELY responsible for ALL cleanup
- Stages NEVER clean up resources themselves
- Two cleanup mechanisms:
  1. Resources returned by stages (tracked via `cleanup()` method)
  2. Resources in `context.metadata['_temp_resources']` (for filtered-out resources)
- Guaranteed cleanup even on errors, cancellation, or early returns

### Thread Safety
- Thread pool executor for non-blocking execution
- Hotkey listener never blocks
- Icon controller uses protocol interface
- Resource locks are thread-safe
- Cancellation via threading.Event

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy `[voice]` and `[hotkey]` sections still work
- Automatic migration to pipeline format
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Warning logged on first run with legacy format

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Main Application**
   - Update `__main__.py` to use `PipelineManager`
   - Wire up `HotkeyManager` to platform-specific listeners
   - Add IconController implementation wrapper around tray icon

2. **Testing**
   - Add more unit tests for pipeline execution
   - End-to-end integration tests
   - Test with real audio recording and transcription

3. **Documentation**
   - Create user-facing documentation
   - Add examples of custom pipelines
   - Document configuration options

## Configuration Example

### New Pipeline Format
```toml
[[pipelines]]
name = "basic_dictation"
enabled = true
hotkey = "<pause>"
stages = [
    {func = "record_audio"},
    {func = "transcribe", provider = "local", minimum_duration = 0.25},
    {func = "type_text"}
]

[[pipelines]]
name = "groq_dictation"
enabled = false
hotkey = "<f12>"
stages = [
    {func = "record_audio"},
    {func = "transcribe", provider = "litellm", model = "groq/whisper-large-v3"},
    {func = "type_text"}
]
```

### Legacy Format (Still Supported)
```toml
[voice]
provider = "local"
minimum_duration = 0.25

[hotkey]
hotkey = "<pause>"
```

The legacy format is automatically migrated to a default pipeline.
